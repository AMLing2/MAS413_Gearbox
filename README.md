SolidWorks render of the gearbox design by group 8:
- Thomas Lønne Stiansen
- Adrian Mathias Lervik Ling
- Ruben Kristoffer Helgestad
- Ole Tobias Næss

# Given Requirements

The gearbox is driven by an electric motor and a requirement is that the piston pump should be in operation for 8 to 10 hours per day, with the following requirements:
- Speed of input shaft: n = 1450 [rpm]
- Power on input shaft: P = 12.5 [kW]
- Total gear ratio: i_t = 17.3 [-]
- Pressure Angle: alpha = 20 [degrees]
- Helix Angle: beta = 15 [degrees]

# Scripts
The iterative process described in the report follows quite directly the code in the "Scripts" directory

# CAD
- 3D models were made parameterized under the following file "Solidworks/SolidWorks_Variables_Equations.txt"
- For compatibility issues with group members using Windows, Linux and Mac OS, the CAD files were shared through OneDrive and not here
- To keep the system simple, these files are added in the .gitignore such that one can copy the files into the "SolidWorks" folder locally and compile them directly there, without pushing them to the repository
